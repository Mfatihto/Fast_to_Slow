# Fast_to_Slow
A VHDL implementation of a Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) example that transfers a signal from a fast clock domain to a slower clock domain. This project includes customizable parameters for the slow clock frequency and demonstrates how to safely pass signals between different clock domains in FPGA designs.
